 TEXT MINING USING WOMENS CLOTHING E-COMMERCE DATA

The Women’s E-Commerce Clothing Review dataset was obtained from 
Kaggle website, which depicts  23486 customer reviews along with 
10 feature variables. The source of the data was anonymized since 
it was derived from real commercial data. Any references on the name
 of the company have been replaced with the text “retailer”.
